A couple weeks ago I shared [my Char Siu 叉燒 recipe](/char-siu-recipe) and asked whoever tried it to let me know and to share pics. Here's the first batch of attempts!

### Mitch

My cousin in Arizona gave it a go but unfortunately was using the more concentrated hoisin paste, and his was too strongly flavoured 😖.

He said it was ok. I think we were both disappointed.

I hastily updated my recipe to caution on this.

### Nicole

For Nicole the ingredients were pretty much all the ones I'd specified in my shopping list for Sainsbury's. Nicole even messaged me from her local Sainos to check with pictures of what she was getting!

She seemed pretty pleased with how it came out. I was happy she enjoyed it!

## Suganya

Another one who double checked on the ingredients before marinading. I also made sure to ask what the soy bean concentration was like.

Suganya is a damn good cook. She has a huge set of Pinterest boards of recipes. I was honoured when she added mine to her Recipes to try board.

When she messaged me on the early May Bank Hol weekend, she told me that her boyfriend said it's the best thing she's ever made for him... 😳

He said to tell me thank you for sharing my recipe. This really made me _super_ happy!!!

I hope the 2 out of 3 good ones have tempted you to give [my Char Siu 叉燒 recipe](/char-siu-recipe) a go and that you'll share what you made with me too!
