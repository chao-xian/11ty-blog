No matter how often people tell me I'm great at whatever, I don't believe it deep inside. It's only if I tell myself that, repeatedly, I sometimes start to be convinced maybe I *don't* suck.

I started to think of using some mental techniques when I went to a talk on imposter syndrome a few years back by a journalist. They'd written about it a little bit, then got known "as an expert on imposter syndrome". Which they thought was ironic as they definitely weren't a psychologist, and only touched on the subject lightly in their writing.

But they made some good points - her experiences were valid and it was ok for her to share! She came up with a great technique that I still try to follow, and impart:

> You cannot use as a measure of your success things that are beyond your control.

Their key example was getting a job:

Writing your CV, making it as best you can and then sending it off is _your_ success. Whether you get picked for an interview, or the job, those are not things that _you_ failed at. They just didn't pick you against a bunch of other people, and you had no control over that.

This caused a shift in my thinking and I even wrote a (very personal and heartfelt) presentation on it which I've never shared before today. When I presented it, a few years ago, at the time I was immensely nerve wracked. But afterwards I felt liberated. To name it, and own it.

There's a couple of other things too: I know what I'm bad at, but I also know what I'm better at than those things. When people tell me I'm great, it's usually because of the way I demonstrate that. And leads me to believe I don't suck as much as I think I do in my head.

I don't need to think "I'm not as good as *them*. I'm as good as *me*"

Hopefully this has helped to change your mind too.
