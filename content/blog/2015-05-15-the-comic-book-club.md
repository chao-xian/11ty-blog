title: The Comic Book Club
---

Inspired by the book club that my ~~wife~~ ex was part of, I decided to start up a Comic Book Club with a few of those local to me who I know are fellow comic book geeks.

The first meet will be on Thursday 28th May and our book will be [Transformers vs GI Joe](http://www.bookdepository.com/Transformers-vs-G-I-Joe-1-John-Barber/9781631401909).

I've bought the [domain name](http://www.thecomicbookclub.co.uk) for a proper club website, but before that's set up here's some more info on what we probably should sort out beforehand.
