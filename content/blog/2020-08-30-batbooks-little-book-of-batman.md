Starting off a series covering the Batman books in my collection, this [Little Book of Batman from Taschen Books](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26786826-the-little-book-of-batman) is a true pocket sized little gem!

I have this on my desk. As I'm working, sometimes I'll pick it up and flick to a random page. The beautiful little snippets curated by former DC president and editor [Paul Levitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Levitz), sprinkles my day with Batman joy.

As with many Batman books, this Little one is organised over a timeline starting from the Golden Age of comics.

With lovely photos of great comic book masters. Alex Toth was best known for his many Hanna Barbera character designs, but my favourite of his work is in this splash image.

As with all of these books, things come to a little bit of a premature end once it hits the Modern Age section. This book only covers up to 2010. We're now a decade on from then.

Highlight from that era in the book for me is the inclusion of some stunning Paul Pope art from Batman Year 100.

My only real gripe with this book is a single panel to represent Batman The Animated Series in the entire book. It's disappointing, but for a little book I guess there isn't much room.

I like this so much that I added others from the Little Book Of series on my wishlist, including the X-Men and Wonder Woman.

They won't be as good as Batman's though.
