Monday last week I went along to a Financial Wellbeing workshop at Horse Guards Road. I'd hoped to something useful out of it, but it was pretty wishy washy. However my main take from it was to not be judgemental or harsh of different spending habits. But to also not go to extremers. Examples were a person who had it ingrained to always scrimp and save money, but when it came to moment to spend that money on a big repair it caused them distress! That's the whole point of savings!

I wrote out an "unofficial roadmap" for the team. I'll be going through it with the Programme Team this week. Will report on it in next update.

Managed to fix my Fabric set up, after failing to do out of hours reboots.

Highlight of the week was going along to Clara Teo's [Design at GDS careers evening for people from under-represented groups](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/design-at-gds-careers-evening-for-people-from-under-represented-groups-tickets-81943474137) that I mentioned last week. It was amazing and I'll be sitting down with her on Friday to pick her brains about it.

Outside of work I decided to try something out, and [I made a thing]({{site.url}}/low-tech-is-the-new-school)!
