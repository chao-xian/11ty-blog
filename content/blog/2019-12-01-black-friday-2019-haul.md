title: Black Friday 2019 haul
---

So Black Friday this year was also on pay day, and during my week off sick. I got myself a handful of stuff:

## Sayonara Wild Hearts (PS4)

Not specifically Black Friday but the price was ¬£9.49 on the day so I bought it. [Sayonara Wild Hearts](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP2333-CUSA14712_00-WILDHEARTSSIEE00) utterly, utterly beautiful and though I normally cba with rhythm action games, this is so cool I'm sticking with it üòç

## God of War PS4

Bought [God of War](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-CUSA07412_00-00000000GODOFWAR?smcid=pdc%3Agb-en%3Aweb-pdc-games-god-of-war-ps4%3Aleadproductinfo-buy-on-playstation-store%3Agod-of-war%3AEP9000-CUSA07412_00-00000000GODOFWAR) for about ¬£13 iirc.

My good pal Pablo was effusive about this game. I had to give it a go. I know he loves games and how much he appreciates the finer things in life. Anyway, as he'd always say "It's only money my friend!" ‚öîÔ∏è

## Every Layout book

I saw a couple of people tweet this as being reduced from $100 to $33 so I bought it. [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev) looks really cool and I hope to pick up a few things frontend wise.

I often end up buying myself some kind of professional skills book on Black Friday and never read them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

## Bitdefender for Mac

Half price for [Bitdefender for Mac](https://www.bitdefender.co.uk/solutions/antivirus-for-mac.html) 3 licences at ¬£19.99 and my licence is about to expire.

Yay for consumerism! üí∏
