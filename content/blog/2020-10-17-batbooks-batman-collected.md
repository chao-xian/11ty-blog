Probably my first coffee table Batman book, and one of the best books I've ever owned. [Chip Kidd's Batman Collected](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Batman-Collected-Chip-Kidd/dp/0823004651) visual love letter to Batman is an opulent photo album.

Chip Kidd not only compiled the contents but applies his talent and style as a graphic designer to the book. The neat and clever dust cover for the original hardback edition is the book's very own Batman mask!

## Uncovering the book

Tada! It's Bruce Wayne with no eyeballs!

## Vintage collection
Every piece in the book is from Chip's personal collection, and the words he introduces the book with spills the joy of collecting for such an icon. It resonates deeply, though my own collection is utterly pitiful in comparison. I get tingles seeing the same toys I have, like the Corgi Batman '66 Batmobile I had as a child.

## Weird and wonderful
Perhaps that's why for me it's not just the beautiful photos of exotic Batman merch, such as the incredibly cute and kitch Japanese wares. It's the connection I also have with these priceless pieces.

Some of them others would think offensive, but I cherish them still. Like this Batman and Robin pairing that I also have (though nipples are not intact).

## Showpiece
I too have this magnificent giant sized Batman The Animated Series action figure, which my cousin and an old friend of ours gave me for my birthday in the week before I left home for university. This 12" (30.5cm) tall model is among my most beloved possessions. Chip Kidd's photography shows how amazing this piece is better than I ever could. How he applies onto a mere toy the effect of an eerie, mythical, mystical air of an idol. It's a book that every Batman fan should treasure.
