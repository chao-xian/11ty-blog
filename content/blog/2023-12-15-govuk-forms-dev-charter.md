A little while ago I'd noticed that even though the devs on the [GOV.UK Forms](https://www.forms.service.gov.uk) team are all great both as individuals and as a group, there were certain things I realised weren't generally agreed upon and I'd assumed would be.

This was perhaps because the team and project were still relatively new compared to the now tween-aged GOV.UK.

I'd been in sessions in the past where a team would come up with a charter, but never one specific for a group of devs before. I decided to run a workshop for just that on our Away Day.

Was pleasantly surprised that Mural had a Team Charter template. I was even more pleased to see so much engagement and activity when we got stuck into the session itself. Many virtual Post-Its were flying around on my screen!

Once we collated the cards into themes, I was able to distill them into the values you can see below. [You can grab a PDF copy of it](/img/govuk-forms-dev-charter/GOV.UK Forms Dev Charter.pdf).

It's great that the team came up with so much and have the commitment to follow the principles on the charter.
