Here's my listicle of great stuff I enjoyed in 2023. It must have been an ok year for me to bother writing this!

## Videogames

### Batman Arkham Collection on Switch
![Batman Arkham Asylum on Switch](/img/2023/arkham.avif)
Particularly Arkham Asylum. Well I haven’t gotten to the other two games, and likely won’t play much of Arkham Knight. But the fantasy fulfilling pleasure of feeling like I AM BATMAN being placed right into my hands is such an addictive delight.

### Super Mario Bros Wonder

I’m not actually one for Mario games in general. I appreciate their very clever design and adore the aesthetic, but they’re pretty hard going for me. Wonder is refreshingly accessible. More than that it’s so sumptuously gorgeous that every bit of animation releases so much dopamine.

### Tetris Effect

Not new and I bought this in early 2022 but it’s been integral to my EMDR conditioning. I’ve been playing it a lot.

## Gigs

### Salute at Koko

First time clubbing since my early 20s and also my first all nighter for even longer. Anxiety beforehand eased once in the middle of the packed dance floor and the vibes was just pure JOY seeing Salute. Please excuse the absolutely atrocious singing.

I’ve been listening to this song throughout the year and it never ever fails to make me feel good. I’m so happy to have managed to see him in person.


### Black Pink at Hyde Park - Born Pink tour

A last minute trip to see one of my favourite girl-bands at Hyde Park. Loved their performance and the vibe.

### Beyoncé at Tottenham Stadium - Renaissance Tour
This was not a concert, it was an _experience_. Utterly phenomenal.

### De La Soul at the Royal Albert Hall
More like Posdnuos and friends. Only Plug 1 of the De La Soul line up was there. But he had with him Prince Paul, Yaslin Bey aka Mos Def, Dres of Black Sheep, and some bloke called Damon.

### Pulp and Wet Leg at Finsbury Park

Jarvis was alright for an old bloke. But Wet Leg was really what I went for!

## TV Shows

### Blue Eyed Samurai
![Mizu](/img/2023/mizu.avif)
[I couldn't stop watching this](https://www.netflix.com/title/81144203) from when I put on the first episode. Mizu as a character is captivating. The animation, particularly the bloody fight sequences, is astounding. The pure beauty in its aesthetic as well is mesmerising. But much more than that is the incredible story. I love this show and I cannot wait for the next series!

### Scott Pilgrim Takes Off
![Scott Pilgrim ensemble](/img/2023/scott-pilgrim.avif)
I could not believe it when they announced this as [an anime](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81643739). It really is it's own thing and not another adaptation as Bryan Lee O'Malley said, and such a mature update as well. Was Rebuild of Neon Genesis Evangelion an inspiration I wonder?

### Ahsoka
![Ahsoka](/img/2023/ahsoka.avif)
Rosario Dawson's [Ahsoka](https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/series/ahsoka/pdpjs2TO4zJ4) is a favourite modern day Jedi of mine. The two new Dark Jedi introduced in this series are also intriguing. I never watched Rebels but know enough about if from recap vids on YouTube to know this is very much the live action sequel to that kids-cgi series.

## Songs
They're not all from my Wrapped but these songs are my favourites that have been on heavy rotation.
