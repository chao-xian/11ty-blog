title: New beginnings
---

I've had blogs before but I've kept them quiet. I find it embarrassing when people read my stuff and yeah that's weird when you're writing blogs. I had one in particular that I think was really esoteric and that was [my learning journal from my 詠春拳功夫 Wing Chun kung fu training](http://wing-chun.blogspot.co.uk/). It's really boring! Although some of the stats suggest people are reading it... The notes from training make no sense anyway and really should be written down in Evernote instead.

And I never got to write about other things that I'm passionate about. Like Batman. I'll probably write a lot about [Batman](http://www.dccomics.com/tags/batman-75).

So this is a new blog and a new beginning. I'm going to just write about what I really like and try to enjoy writing it. Those two ingredients should hopefully make for a blog that I keep at.
