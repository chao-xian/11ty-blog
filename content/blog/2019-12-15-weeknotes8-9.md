It's a double Weeknote as life has been pretty hectic and I'm still battling a hideous cold with the most horrendous cough I've had for at least 2 years. In fact coughing is pretty much all I remember doing this past 2 weeks. Of course, there was an election during it. There was Jen Lambourne and Lorna Tang's leaving dos (tragic loss of wonderful people).

And also my good friend Jon Glassmas left last week. He's been a great friend and mentor to me. He got me into Jeet Kune Do, the martial art that I now train in. It's mostly to add to what I already know but also more because the group I train with are very good, kind people. Jon personifies this. I had the pleasure of helping him teach a beginner's self defence class to women at GDS. But more than that, he's been a friend who I've been able to share with some of the dark moments in my life. He's been super supportive and I'll miss him nagging me on slack to go to class. Now he's going to just have to txt me!

I also sat on the panel for interviews for the next Head of Tech Writing (they can never replace Jen) and it's an interesting insight into the role. I've learned a bit more about strategic thinking from sitting alongside Amanda Diamond, the Head of Content Design.
