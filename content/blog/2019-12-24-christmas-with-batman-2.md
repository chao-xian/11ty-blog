title: Christmas with Batman 2
---

What is Batman if not an icon that attracts great sequels? Not all of them are great, I grant you... but I definitely feel that in the few years since the first [Christmas with Batman](2015-12-24-christmas-with-batman) listicle I've had a few more Christmassy Batman moments I've needed to share.

## Wanted: Santa Clausâ€“Dead or Alive!

This was quite a while before Frank Miller's fascistic fantasies began to leak out in The Dark Knight Returns (and fully exploded in DKR sequels), but you can definitely appreciate the early Frankness in the art, paired with a solidly cheesy script from Denny O'Neil. It's also historically notable as FM's first ever published Batman story.

## Batman - Mask Of The Phantasm

Batman The Animated Series is the perfect distillation of every other version of Batman into this one stylish show. The Mask of the Phantasm movie goes full on with the animation, story and action with Hollywood level production. It's one of the best Batman moments altogether, but sadly only seeing a limited run in theatres. I never got to see it on the big screen.

The Christmas angle? This movie had the honour of being released in theatres on Christmas Day 1993 in the US.

## Only Fools and Horses - Heroes and Villains Christmas special

It's a show I won't say I'm obsessed with, but that I've watched. This Christmas special from 1996 definitely pressed the right buttons when I saw it. Nananananananana-Del-Boy!

## Batman (2016-) Annual #1 - Good Boy

This tale was nominated for an Eisner award back in 2017. It's a modernised origin story of Ace The Bathound in 2016's Batman Annual #1. As celebration of the award nomination, DC released the story for free which you can read below:

Wow that was quite tough to pick out new, great Christmas with Batman moments to follow up from the previous post on this theme. But I'm sure you'll feel that this has been a good Christmassy Batman post.
