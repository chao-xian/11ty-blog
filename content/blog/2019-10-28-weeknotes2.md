I've had a week off with my girls for half term! But I popped in on Thursday morning as I had therapy in the afternoon and my cousin offered to look after my girls all day.

It's was a timely visit, as a PR to ship the "[cookies tweak](https://github.com/alphagov/frontend/pull/2002)" had gone through review, but the original reviewers were too busy to check again. So I stepped in to approve it and then oversaw the deployment.

One of the devs on my team has just recently got production deployment access, and the rule is that Tech Leads are supposed to supervise. This is a sensible approach as simply saying "someone can do it" is not a good framework for ensuring things are done correctly. Making this a formal framework forces me to ensure I am present and sat there when they do a deploy.

Otherwise, I went to MCM London Comic Con!

And we met Tara Strong!!!
