I don't usually do a year review thing. But this one is to try and highlight some stuff and record this Crazy Year. Maybe make some sense of it. It actually started off really good. Just taking a look back at my [insta](https://www.instagram.com/chao_xian/) from the earlier, pre Lockdown 1 part of 2020 showcased some great times.

I'd just had the best Christmas with my family, and my girls loved their time in London.

I got to see [Olafur Eliasson's In Real Life](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/olafur-eliasson) fantastic show at the Tate Modern with my girls and loved it.

I went to Paris for a weekend with my love!

We had a big family gathering for Chinese New Year. (It turned out, it was the last time we saw most of each other for the rest of the year.)

I saw my girl perform as part of her school at the O2.

I had the best Valentine's Day ever.

Then it all went to shit. But even among that, here's the stuff I've enjoyed.

## Songs of 2020

Here's my Spotify playlist and sleeve notes below.

<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3beHEFLBbldwjSRy6CJVo1" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

### Dynamite - BTS
Really also the dance routine of the year.

### Keep your faith to the sky - Willie Scott, The Birmingham Spirituals
I first heard this on the [The Time For Peace Is Now album](https://open.spotify.com/album/5W8xVRMtr6MJg0Ed8FE8QZ?si=SCZuf1fpR-qJtXqcT2Wc1g) which is so lovely.

### Both of us - Jayda G
Is balearic still a word? Well it reminds me of that.

### Medley: It’s all right/For sentimental reasons - Sam Cooke
His best, and performed how it should be.

### I believe in miracles - Extended version - Jackson Sisters
The best of disco!

### I didn’t know - Extended - Skinshape
Fantastically chilled acoustic guitars.

### Know your worth - Khalid, Disclosure
I love Khalid, and Disclosure.

### God only knows - The Beach Boys
The end credits for Love Actually...

### Tian Mi Mi - Teresa Teng
Fun, cheesy, nostalgic. I wrote a [post about it](https://www.chao-xian.co.uk/tian-mi-mi/).

### Gypsy Woman (she’s homeless) - Crystal Waters
Work Slack has a #club-music-club channel. I started a [collaborative Spotify list](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2CRhojiNLQg2efehUOTbtc?si=yMxLu8j7Q0q4n3ux6iRXWA) for it. This song is on heavy, heavy rotation from there.

### Boy With Luv - BTS Halsey
The essence of the song is post-heartbreak recovery, learning to love yourself.

### One Thing - Peter and Kerry
A cover of Amerie's tinkling R&B jam, this acoustic version is lush whimsy.

### Rose Rouge - Jorja Smith
A timely release. One from the Blue Note Re:Imagined album of covers from Blue Note's catalogue, as part of its 80th anniversary. [The powerful video highlights footage from the start of the BLM movement](https://youtu.be/lH6RyVirWcg).

### Experience - Victoria Monét
Such a fun sounding, roller disco pumping tune.

## Games of 2020

Below I've linked to the digital download, but I've also noted where they're on offer during the 2020 Christmas - 2021 January sales.

![Animal Crossing](2020-was-the-year/animal-crossing.avif)

### [Animal Crossing](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-1438623.html)
When Lockdown 1 came in I scrambled to buy a Switch, as did many, many others! Both the Neon Switch and the game itself in physical format were sold out for most of the year.

This game saved me. And a lot of people. It's currently on sale at [ShopTo for £39.85](https://www.shopto.net/en/swan01-animal-crossing-p113348/).

### [Donut County](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Donut-County-1487838.html)
This was sooooo much fun! And funny too! And cheap! A lot of the games on this list were published by Annapurna Interactive, and all were on my Switch (sorry Batman PS4!). It's 70% off and only *£3.29* right now!

### [Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Edition](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/Mario-Kart-8-Deluxe-1173281.html)
The best game to play online with friends and family for the Nintendo Switch. Currently [£39.85 on ShopTo](https://www.shopto.net/en/swma00-mario-kart-8-deluxe-p62221/)!

### [A Short Hike](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/A-Short-Hike-1821799.html)
A beautiful, beautiful little game of pure delight. Short but super sweet. 20% off at only £5.03!

### [If found...](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/A-Short-Hike-1821799.html)
More of a cleverly interactive graphic novel than a game, and alongside Animal Crossing I've found this to be a perfect bedtime pass time on the Switch.

### [Breath of the Wild](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-1173609.html)
This has been top of my list for a very, very long time. The best game of all time for many. I can see why, and it's epic!

### [Sayonara Wild Hearts](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-1646512.html)
I liked it so much, I've bought it twice. Played it at the start of the year on my PS4/PS Vita and now I'm playing it again on my Switch! Also on sale at 40% for £6.59.

### [Hades](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Hades-1821819.html)
On paper, this is not my sort of game. A fantasy based, grinding sort of game. Yet it's brilliant... Also on sale at 20% for £17.99.

## TV Shows of 2020

![The Mandalorian](2020-was-the-year/the-mandalorian.avif)

### [The Mandalorian](https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/series/the-mandalorian/3jLIGMDYINqD)

We'd pre-ordered Disney+ and was able to start streaming by the time Lockdown 1 happened. I'd heard it was good, but I still wasn't prepared for the excellence in this space western adventure. John Favreau has done a great job.

### [Watchmen](https://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/watchmen)
My cousin said it's one of the best TV series he's ever seen. It's really good, and the Tulsa Massacre kick off is gut wrenching. But the ending was a bit meh for me. Jeremy Irons is is especially excellent.

### [Brooklyn Nine Nine season 6](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/70281562)
Chao Xian loves Brooklyn Nine Nine. I'd go Full Boyle for this.

### [Modern Family](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/70143858)
Again another favourite of my cousin's. And it's light hearted fun that I needed to fill the void after getting to the end of Nine Nine on Netflix.

### [The Good Place](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80113701)
[Take it sleazy](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a30721821/the-good-place-ending-take-it-sleazy-letter-mail-explained/).

### [The Crown season 4](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80025678)
The Diana stuff I found tedious. An already well worn story about her. Peeping behind the curtains at the enigma of ERII is more fun.

I've always had a super crush on Gillian Anderson, but her spookily good portrayal of Maggie has likely given many a Tory Boy new banking material. Which is to say: off putting.

### [The Boys](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/detail/B0875M5LYG/)
I've never read the books. People keep telling me to. But this series is awesome. I still marvel in disbelief in the sheer awfulness of Homelander.

### [Umbrella Academy season 2](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80186863)
The angst and sadness of the first series is replaced with a more upbeat and fun second run. I'm not sure if the adaptation is accurate to the comics but I didn't care.

### [She-Ra and the Princesses of Power season 5](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80179762)
An altogether excellent series that I'm so glad my girls got into, finishing off with a perfect ending where hidden love is finally revealed.

### [Travelling Man](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/travel-man-48-hours-in/on-demand/58579-001)
Idk, I think this was both escapist fantasy and mild self-torture. Ha.

### [Good Omens](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/detail/B07S76B6YY/)
One of my favourite books (I've read it about 5 times, and I don't really read much of books) and I tried to re-read before watching this for the past year. I even attempted to get into the audio book. Decided to watch the first episode as I knew I'd go far enough into the book again. Then caved and binged on the rest.

## So, happy new year...
